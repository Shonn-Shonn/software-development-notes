Project organization
The project organization specifies that roles and responsibilities,number of staff 
in each role, teams
.To increase the likelihood of project success,one project member should have experience
with a similar system


Project Tasks and activities
The tasks and activities specify the work that needs to be done.
task->a well define work assignment for a role
activity->a group of related tasks


Plan driven
Tasks,activities and their schedule are planned in detail at the start of the project

Agile driven
Tasks,activities and their schedule are incrementally planned with most details provided as the project processes.


Which approach to use is highly project dependent.
Some combination is often most appropriate.

Project Schedule
The project schedule specifies:
-task ordering -> dependencies(sequential,parallel)
-time estimates for each task -> start time, likely duration
-resource assignment -> people,hardware,software
-milestones -> important management decision points;
-deliverable- -> specifications,documents,code,etc.


Often three levels of schedule are maintained:
-master schedule: for management,client communication -> rigid
-macro schedule: for day-to-day project management -> semi-rigid
(Macro-planning is all about the bigger picture and the long-term vision.)
-micro schedule: fro team management -> highly flexible
(Micro is a surefire way to get bogged down in unnecessary detailsâ€”meaning you might never achieve your end goal)
Charts and graphs are commonly used to manage schedules.


Estimates
Estimating is trying to quantify something before it occurs.

The project plan may provide estimates of 
-size(lines of code (loc),number of subsystems,number of classes,etc)
-effort(person x duration)
-productivity(size/effort)
-duration(months until delivery)
-development cost(labour)

.Estimating is based on:
-experience -historical data -models -courage!


Estimating carries inherent risk.
(Which we try to minimize as much as possible)




The risk associated with estimating is reduced:if we;
-establish project scope in advance
-use historical data from past projects.
-divide and conquer
-break into small parts,estimate and sum.
